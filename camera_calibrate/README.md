# Camera Calibration Using OpenCV

Calibrate your camera using OpenCV.

## Compilation

To compile `camera_calibrate_with_undistortion.cpp` code files, use the following:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
## Usage

Refer to the following to use the compiled files:

```
./build/camera_calibrate_with_undistortion
```

## Parameter Acquisitiion

The camera intrinsic matrices and distortion coefficients are generated by the attached MATLAB script, or run the `camera stereo calibration` App from
MATLAB. The intrinsic matrices and distortion coefficients are saved as .txt files and currently they are hardcoded into `camera_calibrate_with_undistortion.cpp`, so further work is needed to automate such pipeline.

The current `camera_calibrate_with_undistortion.cpp` implementation is basically a poor-quality fix to obtain the camera rectification matrices because the MATLAB does not support the generation of rectification matrices and the original C++ implementation causes exception in calibrating the cameras from the given image set.
